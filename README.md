## requirements

[vision](https://github.com/sk222sw/nxplaylist/wiki/vision)

[use cases](https://github.com/sk222sw/nxplaylist/wiki/use-cases)

## testing

[test cases](https://github.com/sk222sw/nxplaylist/wiki/tests)

## runnable version

[nxPlaylist](https://nxplaylist.herokuapp.com/)

## installation

set up your favorite php/apache stack. the application is configured to connect to the current database at clearDB. edit DALBase.php to change database.

## note

clearDB sometimes gives a "max user connections" error when I add more than one post to a table. this seems to be a common problem, but I haven't found a good solution to it (and my code could of course be the problem). if you run into this error please contact me at "sk222sw Ã¤t student.lnu.se" or use the login credentials from DALBase.php and delete some or all rows in the Playlist and Track tables.
